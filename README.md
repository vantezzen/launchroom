# launchroom

> Framework-first, zero fuss self-hosted deployments

launchroom is an open-source, self-hosted deployment platform built for modern web frameworks. Designed with developers in mind, it automates environment setup, service configuration, and multi-environment managementâ€”so you can go from git push to live app without the usual hassle. With native support for Next.js and Laravel (and more on the way), launchroom empowers you to deploy smarter and iterate faster.
